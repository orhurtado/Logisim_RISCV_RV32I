# Logisim_RISCV_RV32I
Computer RiscV 32 bits Integer Logisim Preliminar Design

These designs are part of the 'Computer Architecture' course taught during the year 2023 at the Bolivian Private University (UPB) and instructed by me. The purpose of these designs is purely didactic and focuses on presenting the architecture of a 32-bit RISC-V computer and an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) designed to operate exclusively with integers. Due to their entirely didactic focus, these designs are not intended to be fully functional.
